## Technical

This is a React app that uses the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) to fetch the questions. 
React Hooks were used to control form state/user input, API calls and conditional rendering. 






## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
